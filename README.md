# Bash Quiz 4

"Create a sed script which makes all comments consistent. Comment lines will begin with either “//” or
“#” and may have leading spaces or tabs. Replace these instances with “//” followed by a space and the
rest of the original line (the comment itself). Also remove any lines beginning with “%”. Include the
command to run the script for a file named file1.php (contents below) and print output to
file1Clean.php."
